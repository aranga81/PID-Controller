# PID control Project

## Introduction:
Main objective of this project was to design a PID controller & tune the gains so that car follows the track in the provided simulator. The simulator provides CTE (cross track error = current car positition - set point), speed, steering angle data as inputs. 

### Effect of Proportional / Derivative & Integral gains..!!

The proportional gain (P) - 'Kp' in the code has an apparent affect on the car in the simulator. Steering angle adjustment scales linearly with the gain and system or the car reaches marginal stability - hence oscillating heavily. 

Differential gain (kd) reduces the oscillations or overshoot as it exerts control action looking at the rate of change of error or cte in our case. The greater the cte error change more is the affect of Kd.



## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5

  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) 

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)
